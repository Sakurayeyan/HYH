Come on, Red. Giddyup

Giddyup, come on. Ride 'em, cowboy

Let's get those outlaws

We're almost there. Come on!

Got it. We got it. We're almost there

Come on

Hey, Boyd

How long were you out in the corn?

Not all night again, I hope

I don't want you to cry anymore, Eden

Don't worry, Eden

Nothing ever really dies in the corn

Boyd! Damn it. Where the hell you been?

Boyd...

Boyd, no!

All units be advised, there is a hostage situation

at the Rylstone Children's Home

The local sheriff and his farmer buddies

have used some kind of animal sedative gas

to try and solve it

By all reports, it sounds like a total disaster

Yeah, I'm here now

These idiots are literally pumping halothane in

to try to take this kid down

Well, there goes my reelection

The only silver lining is that goddamn space cadet in there

That little runt was wandering around the corn for four days

before anybody realized she wasn't one of the casualties

from the goddamn gas

Pastor, try and find out if that boy said anything

that would explain why he snapped

and killed all those people

So...

I guess it follows that, uh

you'll need a place to live after all this, huh?

Who knows?

If you're a good girl

then maybe we could manage it

for you to come and live with me

I have a stable with a couple of old nags in it

You can pick one out and ride it

How's that sound?

God dang it!

This one piece is driving me nuts!

Oh

There she is. The Red Queen

You like the Red Queen?

The Red Queen makes the world the way she wants it to be

E - Eden, I'm - I'm really sorry about what happened

to all your little friends in the home

I really am

It was an unfortunate accident

I - I have to ask you

That boy, did he say anything?

No. Not really

Oh, uh, except just to say he was sorry

Sorry?

Sorry for killing every adult in the facility?

No

I think he was sorry for not killing all of you

Hey! Get back!

Hey, what's wrong with you? !

That should be public!

Cool

Look at this stuff

How many times did I try and warn them?

The stuff that they put into this ground

without even barely reading a label

Ever notice how the words "maize" and "maze"

like a corn maize and a puzzle - are the same?

A maze of maize

Weird, huh?

Sure. "Amazing"

Har - dee - har. Bite me

Hey!

Toxins grow on the stalks and leaves of rotting crops

It's a fungus

It can make you sick or even die

Yeah

And, uh, hallucinations

Whatever you say, Bo - What? It's true

You know, some people say it was responsible

for the Salem witch trials

Fun talking to you too, sis

Ahh!

Mmm! Smell those toxins. Velvety and delicious

So good - Ceece, stop

Think I'll have a second helping

Cut it out. Stop playing with that stuff, okay?

Now, listen to me. I...

That's not why I brought you out here, okay?

This is

I literally haven't been able to sleep for a month

because I...

Here

I leave next week

Look, it's an undergraduate degree in microbiology

All right? It's not an eternity

It is

It is! Why would you ever come back?

I know you hate it here

Because

Because of you. Because of Dad

And look, Ceece, you know, you'll leave here one day too

With my cruddy grades?

I'll be stuck here forever

In this creepy, dying place

No. Rylstone's not dying

It's been a hard couple years. You know?

A lot of mistakes have been made

A lot of shitty, shitty decisions

But with - with a little time and care

then all this...

it can be fixed

Yeah

Sounds awesome, Bo

Eden! God, you scared the shit out of us

Seriously

What's with the wig?

Today I am the Red Queen

Crud

Um, speaking of which let's go

Come on, Red! Giddyup, come on

Cecil, you're not gonna want to miss this

Wally Thomas Pratt!

"For the crime of cruel and unusual treatment

of your very own hunting dog

you are hereby sentenced to die!"

You killed Gibber!

Hey! I know this is for play and all, but that wasn't my fault

I didn't give Gibber that poison

He ate it out of some rat trap

And you just watched him suffer!

He was just an old hound dog

Liar! - Billy Barnes!

Dog killer!

Hey, Wally

Screw you, Barnes

Off the edge, Wally!

Walk the plank, walk the plank

Walk the plank, Wally Thomas Pratt

Walk the plank, walk the plank

Walk the plank, Wally Thomas Pratt

Ow! Jeez! Dang it, Billy, quit jabbing me with that thing!

Quit stalling! Off the end!

Off the end!

Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

Jump!

Do what they say! Jump!

Come on!

Hey! What the hell are you doing?

Hey, Calder

What in frick's name are you doing on my grandma's car?

Cam?

Get off. Get the hell off

Are you effing crazy?

You dumbass idiots

You've dented the quarter panels

You cracked the window

Damn
