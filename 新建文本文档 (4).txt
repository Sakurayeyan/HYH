Come on, Red. Giddyup

Giddyup, come on. Ride 'em, cowboy

Let's get those outlaws

We're almost there. Come on!

Got it. We got it. We're almost there

Come on

Hey, Boyd

How long were you out in the corn?

Not all night again, I hope

I don't want you to cry anymore, Eden

Don't worry, Eden

Nothing ever really dies in the corn

Boyd! Damn it. Where the hell you been?

Boyd...

Boyd, no!

All units be advised, there is a hostage situation
